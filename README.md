Main is the initial problem that produces race conditions
<br>Branch is a solution implemented with Semaphores

[Video Link](https://youtu.be/TKF38EWrCsw)

Race Condition occurs at about 36 Seconds into the video. The video is short though so you can also just watch the whole thing if you'd like.


I didn't use anything special in Python for this project so I think you are able to just open the code in an IDE or editor like VSCode and run it.
Python 3.8.3 64-bit

As said in the video the n = 100 and the k & t values follow the project description and are randomly generated numbers.
Let me know if you have any issues with any part of my submission.
